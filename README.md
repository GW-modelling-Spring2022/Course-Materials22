## Google Drive materials
We have a shared google drive folder for the course [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12T-1ABbLvpKR_RYDqSaHp4E7LJ8nLBhV?usp=sharing). This is where we will keep group presentations and our class notes so that everyone has access for future reference. 

For every assignment we will have three contributions to this drive: 
1. Any slides that the discussion leaders prepare for the week on the challenge/discussion questions (to be posted to the `Synthesis_Presentations` by class on Thursday). 
2. The synthesis video created after the class discussion by the presenting group (to be posted to the `Synthesis_Videos` folder by the Monday following the class discussion).
3. Answers to our glossary questions to be added to our [`Groundwater modeling Glossary`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nt_z64P7mRmEbcRNaPXDQTAfBO4iTTIY9HDg3ZHW4U/edit?usp=sharing) by the start of class the Tuesday following the class discussion.
