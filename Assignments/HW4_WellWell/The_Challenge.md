# Well, Well <!-- omit in toc -->

This week we will be adding a pumping well to our model. A flopy code is provided to you that recreates the 2D homogeneous box model with constant head boundary conditions.

## Model Description
â€‹The model that you have been provided is set up for a homogeneous medium with a well pumping at a constant rate.  The well is located at [0,10,15] and it is withdrawing water at a rate of -8 (note, the rate is negative to indicate water being removed from the domain).  You need to move the well to the center of the domain [0,12,12] and change the rate to -10.  You will be asked to modify the location of the domain and examine the impacts on flow across the boundaries and the steady state head and drawdown distributions. 

Remember that the focus of this course is primarily to use models to improve your hydrogeologic understanding.  In other words, getting the model to run correctly is step one, then The Challenge begins!

## The Challenge
*If you need help getting the starter code going refer back to the instructions from last weeks homework. The general process is the same you will need to (1)Copy the assignment into your Homework Repo, (2)open the starter code and confirm that the notebook is using your `gwmod` python environment (3)update your the moddir path to match the location where your MODFLOW executable is (Note: you can grab this path from your HW3 notebook as it won't change from week to week*

1. For the initial well location, plot the total flow into the left (constant head = 20) and out of the right (constant head = 10) boundaries.  (The code, as provided, makes this plot for you.)  
   - Explain why the values are not constant along the boundary (relate to the definition of a Type I boundary).  
   - Explain the shapes of the flow distributions and why they are not the same for the left (inflow) and right (outflow) boundaries.
   -  You are still modeling stead state conditions?  So, what is supplying water to the well?

2. Plot series of the flow left-to-right along a line that passes through the center of the well [:,12]
   - How do you interpret the flow along this transect?  (Hint, also look at the flow along a transect just upgradient from the well [:,11]).

3. Then, look at the plot of equipotentials (i.e. the constant head lines) and flow vectors.  Describe how water flows through the domain.  To aid in your description, draw a line through all of the flow vectors that terminate in the well.  This approximates the capture zone of the well. Use this to refine your description of the flow system, being as specific as possible about where water that ends up being extracted by the well originates on the inflow boundary.  

4. Then, look at the plan view drawdown plot. 
   -  Why aren't the drawdown contours circles?  Either explain why this is correct, or fix the plot. 
   -  Why are the drawdown contours not equally spaced?    

5. Move the well to [0,5,5].  Use all plots necessary to describe fully how water is flowing through the domain with the well in this location.  Be sure to include the drawdown plot in your discussion - compare this plot to the equipotentials and flow vectors.  Something is not right about how the well location is shown.  Fix it and explain what was wrong!!

**BONUS** 
Before running the model, predict what you would happen to the inflow/outflow boundary fluxes if you reduced the pumping rate to -5 with the well located at [0,12,12].  Were you correct?  If not, how were you wrong? Now predict what would happen if you increased the pumping rate to -20.  Still correct?  Now try -25.  Uh oh, what happened?? 

## Glossary Questions
1. What are equipotentials? How do we create them from MODFLOW Models? 
2. What are flowlines?  (BONUS thought experiment: How can you impose a no flow boundary based on symmetry?  Give it a shot to explain WHY this works in a couple of sentences.)
3. What are flownets? And how does a flonet vary from a map of equipotentials with flow lines drawn on it? 
4. Define the concept of 'capture' in a way that a non-expert might understand? (e.g. think about our homework problem, if the right boundary represented a stream, what would the impact of the well be on the stream?)

## What to Submit
